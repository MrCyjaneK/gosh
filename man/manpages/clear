clear 0.0.0

NAME
    clear - clear the terminal screen

SYNOPSIS
    clear

DESCRIPTION
    clear (at the moment) works only on linux builds. On windows it prints `unsupported' notification and try to clear the screen anyway.
    To make sure that some script (that should fail on errors) will not fail, clear always return 0, even if it didn't work.
