man 0.0.0

NAME
    man - simple manual reader for gosh

SYNOPSIS
    man --list
    man [page]

DESCRIPTION
    man is a manual page reader. To match with the gosh philosophy, it doesn't have any depedencies - such having the files in the system. They are embeded inside, and you can check all pages with `man --list`

    If you need to embed some manual pages inside, simply put a file in /gosh/man/manpages/ and recompile it.
